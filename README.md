My portfolio and projects

## Overview 
This is a basic JS/CSS (SCSS)/HTML project that was built to showcase my knowledge of programming. This is one of my first projects and within it, it contains other projects that I've decided to showcase. 

## Running the project 
### Pre-requisites 
* SCSS (Follow the guide [here](https://sass-lang.com/guide)) to get started with SCSS
* LiveServer (Can be installed globablly with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) or as a [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer))

Because this is a simple HTML/SCSS/JS project, this only requires SCSS & LiveServer to get started. Follow the guide for the npm or vscode extension link, then run it within the cloned repository.
